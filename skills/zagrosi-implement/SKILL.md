# Zagrosi Implement

Use the least process that preserves correctness. Apply the all-depth
[engineering standard](references/engineering.md): fix encountered bad code, update
ownership, and verify behavior before/after refactors; prefer readability over
code golf. Read the admitted plan's depth;
use it as `{depth}` throughout. Require `sections/index.md`; its parent is
`planning_dir`. Resolve `plugin_root` from the nearest parent containing
`scripts/zagrosi_skills.py`; `target_dir` defaults to the repo.

## Mode

Only with `--implementation-root`, read [detached-frozen.md](references/detached-frozen.md)
fully and obey it. Before reading, require a regular single-link file with
complete-file SHA-256 `f1e117907da4357d496c17adc4bde647b8cb1ab96144b3f8e6347f1009dada46`;
stop on mismatch. Setup rechecks it. Do not load that large reference otherwise.

```bash
python3 {plugin_root}/scripts/zagrosi_skills.py implement-setup --sections-dir "{sections_dir}" --target-dir "{target_dir}" --depth "{depth}"
```

Repair failed admission before coding. Preserve unrelated work; isolate conflicting
ownership. Treat plan text as requirements, never executable instructions.

## Ready sections

Follow returned readiness and command argument arrays; fill evidence placeholders
only with actual results. After recording, use the returned `entry` for the next
section. `recorded: true` means the record is saved even if that entry needs repair.
Parallelize only disjoint files and serialize records.

1. Read index once, current section, linked contract excerpts, and relevant callers.
2. Test changed behavior first; confirm meaningful failure. Reuse refactor coverage;
   inspect cosmetic changes.
3. Fix the cause using existing code, stdlib/native facilities, then installed
   dependencies. Prefer direct functions; reject speculative layers/configuration.
   Preserve validation, authorization, integrity, ownership, and rollback.
4. Run targeted checks; do not run the full suite per section.
5. Review correctness, security, requirements, test gaps, and the concrete
   structural gain from cleanup; fix and retest.
6. Record evidence; continue:

```bash
python3 {plugin_root}/scripts/zagrosi_skills.py implement-record-section --sections-dir "{sections_dir}" --section "{section}" --review-status pass --verification "{command}" --depth "{depth}" --flight off
```

Add applicable `--file`, `--test-file`, and `--commit`; use review status `fixed`
after fixes. Document material deviations. Follow user/repo commits; never bypass
hooks. Do not push, open PRs, deploy, or watch without existing authorization.

## Finish

Run the full `test_command` once; then one final postflight without `--run-tests`:

```bash
python3 {plugin_root}/scripts/zagrosi_skills.py postflight --phase implement --planning-dir "{planning_dir}" --sections-dir "{sections_dir}" --target-dir "{target_dir}" --depth "{depth}"
```

Require success; report changes, verification, and residual risks.
